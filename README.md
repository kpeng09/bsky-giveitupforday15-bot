A simple bot that posts Mr. Krabs ringing his bell on day 15th of the month to BlueSky. Created by me (@projectsbykay.bsky.social)

This is a personal project because I love the meme since years ago and look forward to it every month on my social media. I have wanted to build my own bot so this was a good opportunity play around with BlueSky's API and TypeScript.

The bot uses Typescript, BlueSky's API, and GitHub Actions to schedule cron jobs.
